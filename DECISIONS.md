# DECISIONS — Hygieia (`hygieia`)

Dated, append-only. Any non-obvious choice lands here (CLAUDE.md §5).

## ADR-0001 — 2026-10-05 — GitHub Pages, public repo, no Supabase project yet

**Decision.** The repo is **public** (operator's choice at NEW PRODUCT time) and the app is hosted on
**GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, project site at `intotheveil.github.io/hygieia/`,
Vite `base: '/hygieia/'`). **No Supabase project is created yet.** The client is wired
(`src/lib/supabase.ts`) and reads only `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; with neither
set the app runs in local-only mode and makes no request.

**Why.** The house stack names "Supabase (EU project)", but P0 persists nothing and holds no secret,
so an empty project would be cost and surface with no user. Pages on this plan requires a public
repo, which the operator accepted. When a phase needs persistence (saved plans, fridge lists,
accounts), the project is created **in an EU region** and this ADR is superseded, the way Themis's
ADR-0002 superseded its ADR-0001.

**Consequences.** (1) Everything in the bundle is public; any model call (meal/calorie estimation by
AI) needs a server-side proxy, not a browser key. (2) CLAUDE.md §9 P1 (data spine) and P2 (auth)
are deferred, not skipped. (3) The static-site secret boundary is enforced by `eslint.config.js`
(server-only names and non-allow-listed `VITE_*` names are lint errors in `src/**`).

## ADR-0002 — 2026-10-05 — bilingual by type, no i18n library in P0

**Decision.** Greek and English are peers in one typed `Dictionary` (`src/i18n/dictionary.ts`): two
literals satisfy one interface, so a missing translation is a compile error. Greek is the default
(`index.html lang="el"`, Greek browsers), a stored choice wins, English otherwise. No i18next or
similar in P0.

**Why.** The product is bilingual by definition, and the failure mode to design against is a key
present in one language and blank in the other. The type system catches that for free; a runtime
library would add a dependency and move the check to test time. If content (recipes, diets) grows
to need pluralisation, interpolation or lazy-loaded namespaces, this ADR is reopened.

## 2026-10-05 — NEW PRODUCT step 4: no `BRAIN_DISCIPLINE.md` append

The kit already installs that text as CORE §0 via `kit.mjs apply`; ZEUS.md step 4 says not to
append it (zeus BRAIN §4 B5). Recorded so the absence is not mistaken for a skipped step.

## 2026-10-05 — `.claude/.no-greek-scan` present on purpose

The kit guard blocks Greek script in commits by default (it reads as raw client data). Hygieia ships
Greek copy in `src/i18n/dictionary.ts` by design, so the marker disables that single rule. The other
guard rules still run.

## ADR-0003 — 2026-10-05 — shared Supabase project: Alyssos's `alyssos`, own schema `hygieia`

**Decision.** Hygieia persists to **Alyssos's LIVE Supabase project `alyssos`** (ref
`jenbakghoiaiwceyrshz`, eu-west-1), not a project of its own. Every Hygieia object lives ONLY in schema
**`hygieia`**; nothing is created, altered or granted in `public`, `auth`, `storage`, `extensions` or
`supabase_migrations`. Operator ruling 2026-10-05 ("if you can't create a new one, use Alyssos database
as shared") after three attempts to create a dedicated project were cancelled by the permission UI.
This **supersedes ADR-0001's "no Supabase" clause**; the GitHub Pages hosting part stands.

**Rules that make sharing safe (the Themis ADR-0002 rulebook, applied here).**

1. **No `supabase db push`, `supabase link`, `supabase db reset` or `supabase migration *`** against
   this project. Alyssos owns `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`; a Hygieia version recorded there
   would break Alyssos's next push.
2. **Tracking in `hygieia.schema_migrations`.** Migrations are plain timestamped files
   `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_hygieia_<name>.sql`, forward-only, checksummed.
3. **Applied only by a Management-API applier** (`npm run db:apply`, to be lifted from Themis/Pluto),
   reading `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `HYGIEIA_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` from the shell env. Dry-run is the
   default; `--apply` commits, and only with the operator's go.
4. **Rehearsed first by `npm run db:gate`** (PGlite, throwaway, no credential), with a RED-proof.
5. **The browser client is pinned to schema `hygieia`** (`db: { schema: 'hygieia' }`), so `.from('x')` can
   never reach Alyssos's `public` tables by accident. `hygieia` must be added to the project's exposed
   schemas (PostgREST `db-schemas`) before the client can read it — an operator dashboard setting.
6. **Shared `auth.users`.** A Hygieia account IS an Alyssos auth user (2 exist today). Hygieia's
   `hygieia.profiles` keys on `auth.users.id`; no trigger on `auth.users`. Email templates and OAuth
   providers (Google) are project-wide and must be configured so both apps' redirect URLs are allowed.
7. **Alyssos's data is never read or written by Hygieia**, and Alyssos's brain gets a §5 warning that
   a second product lives in its project (owed: `alyssos` is not yet a brained fleet repo).

**Why.** The operator's call. It avoids a 14th project's cost and setup for a product whose data is
small (content tables + per-user saved plans). Alyssos is also EU-hosted (eu-west-1), so the house
"EU project" rule holds.

**Consequences.** (1) P1 starts with the applier + gate scaffolding before any table. (2) Exposing the
`hygieia` schema and the Google OAuth app are operator dashboard steps. (3) **Noted during inspection:
`public.spatial_ref_sys` has RLS disabled** — that is PostGIS's reference table in Alyssos's own
schema, not Hygieia's concern, but it is flagged to the operator (Supabase advisory, 2026-10-05).

## ADR-0004 — 2026-10-05 — installable PWA on GitHub Pages

**Decision.** The site is an installable Progressive Web App: `vite-plugin-pwa` (Workbox) generates
`manifest.webmanifest` and `sw.js` (`autoUpdate`), icons live in `public/icons/` (SVG source,
PNGs via `npm run icons` / sharp), Google Fonts are runtime-cached, and `npm run check:pwa` gates CI
on the BUILT artifact (manifest fields, every icon present, service worker, registration).

**Why.** Operator request ("make the GitHub page an installable app"). A phone home-screen app suits
"what's in my fridge" and workout sessions; Pages is static, so a service worker is the only way to
get offline and install behaviour there.

**Consequences.** `start_url`/`scope` are `/hygieia/` and must follow Vite `base` if the site ever moves
to a root domain. The SW precaches the bundle: a deploy is picked up on the next visit (autoUpdate),
never instantly. `navigateFallback` serves `index.html` offline for deep links.

## 2026-10-05 — per-user writes never send `user_id`; the DB default supplies it

**Decision (P2.4).** The client never includes `user_id` in any INSERT/UPSERT payload to `fridge_lists`,
`saved_plans` or `favourites`, and never filters on it: the column is `not null default auth.uid()` and RLS
(`user_id = auth.uid()` on every verb, proven in `db:gate`) scopes every read and write to the caller.
The payload types in `src/user/source.ts` have no `user_id` member, so sending it is a type error, and
`src/user/source.test.ts` sweeps every recorded call for it. **Why:** the server is the single authority on
who owns a row — a client-supplied id is at best redundant and at worst a spoof attempt RLS has to refuse;
a client-side `eq('user_id', …)` would duplicate the policy and invite a false sense of safety when it is
forgotten. Same discipline as P2.3's `is_admin` (never sent; the column grant forbids it).

## 2026-10-05 — every `hygieia` function revokes EXECUTE explicitly (per-schema default privileges cannot)

`alter default privileges in schema hygieia revoke execute on functions from public` does NOT remove the
hardwired PUBLIC EXECUTE on functions created later: per-schema defaults are ADDED to the global default
(Postgres docs; proven in PGlite 2026-10-05 — `proacl` stays NULL, `has_function_privilege('anon', …)` =
true). A global revoke would be project-wide and touch Alyssos (ADR-0003), so it is forbidden. Rule: every
function a Hygieia migration creates ends with `revoke execute on function … from public, anon` (trigger
functions also `authenticated`; an RPC then grants `authenticated`). `npm run db:gate` sweeps every
function for anon/PUBLIC EXECUTE and a pinned `search_path`; the sweep is RED-verified (P1.8).

## 2026-10-05 — P1.5–P1.8 schema choices

- **Policies per role, never `to anon, authenticated` with `or hygieia.is_admin()`** (PLAN §1.4): anon holds
  no EXECUTE on any `hygieia` function, so a shared policy would error for anon. The gate asserts "every anon
  policy is TO anon alone" and "no write policy admits anon or PUBLIC".
- **Client writes are column-limited grants, not only policies:** `profiles.is_admin` and every per-user
  `user_id` have NO INSERT/UPDATE grant (so `user_id` always comes from `default auth.uid()`); content
  `id`, `slug`, `created_at`, `reviewed_*` are never client-updatable; `stamp_review()` writes the review
  stamp as a trigger (column privileges do not apply to trigger assignments).
- **Nullability follows `src/content/types.ts`**, not the looser §2 prose: ingredient price fields and
  `category` are `not null`; `equipment_*`/`note_*` are nullable as a pair (`(a is null) = (b is null)`);
  `image_path`, `source_url` nullable. Every table (children too) carries `created_at`/`updated_at`.
- **Fixture rows obey the seed-id rule** (`id = md5('hygieia:<table>:' || slug)::uuid`, slugs `fx-*`), so
  the "every row id = md5(…)" check is non-vacuous before P1.12 and bites on every seeded row after.
- **Gate and `npm test` share one check list** (`checksFor` in `scripts/db-gate/catalogue.mjs`); the Vitest
  twin pins the check names, so a check added to the catalogue without a case fails the suite.

## 2026-10-05 — P1.14 prove-red: close the write-policy gap in place, keep the check names

- **Write-policy checks probe filtered AND blind.** prove-red showed `saved_plans` UPDATE / `favourites`
  DELETE `using (true)` leave the gate GREEN: `… where user_id = A` makes Postgres AND the SELECT policy in,
  masking the open write policy. The fix adds a blind (no-WHERE) UPDATE/DELETE to the EXISTING checks
  (`UB's UPDATE/DELETE of A's rows has no effect`, the profiles twin, content `UA's status update has no
effect`) and asserts A's rows unchanged — instead of adding new checks — because `db-isolation.test.ts`
  pins the name set and is outside P1.14's scope. Net: the twin stays green and gets the stronger probe.
- **`RED ok` means exit code exactly 1**, not merely ≠ 0: a crash (Windows 0xC0000409) is `CRASH`, never proof.

## 2026-10-06 — P5.3 Lighthouse mobile gate: fonts self-hosted; gate at 90 kept

- **Fonts self-hosted; Lighthouse gate at 90 kept.** The render-blocking Google Fonts stylesheet in
  `index.html` cost the home page ~15 Lighthouse mobile performance points (79 baseline → 94 with the
  fonts origins blocked, nothing else changed) and made the score bimodal (79 ↔ 93) with the cold
  DNS/TLS latency to a third party. Inter and Literata now ship as `@fontsource-variable/*` (one woff2 per
  script subset selected by `unicode-range`, Greek included, `font-display: swap`), imported at the top of
  `src/index.css`, bundled by Vite and precached by the service worker — the installed app renders Greek
  offline from the first visit, and no third party sits on the first-paint path. The thresholds stay
  performance / accessibility / best-practices ≥ 90 mobile (CI: −5 on performance only, documented in
  `scripts/check-lighthouse.mjs`); a lower bar was rejected in favour of fixing the cause.
- **The Lighthouse audit server differs from the e2e server on purpose** (`scripts/check-lighthouse.mjs`
  reuses `resolveRequest` from `e2e/support/pages-server.mjs`): text is gzipped like Pages does (the e2e
  server serves identity, which inflated the simulated LCP by ~1.9 s), and the deep-link fallback
  (`404.html`) is served with status 200 because Lighthouse refuses to audit an errored document. Bytes
  identical; the 404 contract stays proven by `npm run e2e`. One fresh Chrome per route, so no route
  inherits another's warm connections or storage.
- **No `<link rel="preload">` for the hero.** Measured: it left home's LCP unchanged (render-bound: the
  image waits for React, not for bytes) and made every other route download a 42 kB image it never shows
  (−3 points on `/auth`). The hero is a `<picture>` (WebP 800w/1216w from `npm run brand`, JPEG fallback,
  `fetchPriority="high"`); `registerSW.js` is injected with `defer` (`injectRegister: 'script-defer'`).
